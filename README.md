# Hello ðŸ‘‹, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

**I'm Javier Feliu**, a **Senior Full-Stack Developer** based in Panama City, Panama. Over the years, Iâ€™ve built robust, large-scale web applications using **Python (Flask)** on the backend and **React** on the frontend. My focus is on delivering performant, maintainable, and scalable solutions.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Web Applications**  
  Building and maintaining large-scale projects with Python/Flask, React, PostgreSQL, and containerization (Docker).

- **Automation & Airflow**  
  Developing workflows to streamline and orchestrate business processes, reducing operational overhead and cost.

- **Chrome Extensions**  
  Creating internal tools that automate tasks on third-party systems lacking APIs, boosting efficiency for internal teams.

- **Infrastructure Maintenance**  
  Sole maintainer of our self-hosted **Sentry** setup and our **Jenkins** CI/CD pipelines, ensuring smooth deployments and reliable monitoring.

- **AI-Driven Web Applications**  
  Recently leveraging the **Anthropic API** to develop intelligent, next-generation applications.

I love tackling complex challenges, continually learning new technologies, and sharing knowledge with fellow developers. Thanks for stopping byâ€”feel free to browse my repositories for a glimpse of my work!
