# Hello 👋, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

**I'm Javier Feliu**, an **Engineering Manager and Senior Full-Stack Developer** based in Panama City, Panama. I lead an 8-person engineering team at a private ad tech company, splitting my time between hands-on development and team leadership. I focus on building high-performance, scalable systems and helping teams deliver better software.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Distributed Systems & Performance**  
  Designed and built ultra-low-latency APIs with sub-50ms response times across multiple AWS regions, leveraging intelligent caching and cross-region deployment strategies for fraud detection and ad tech applications.

- **Full-Stack Development**  
  Built and maintained large-scale web applications using Python (Flask, Django, Airflow), JavaScript (React, Express, Chrome Extensions), PostgreSQL, Redis, and modern cloud infrastructure (AWS, DigitalOcean, CloudFront).

- **Process Automation & Orchestration**  
  Developed complex Airflow workflows that automate business processes, customer onboarding, and infrastructure updates. Built Chrome extensions with distributed task execution for automating operations across third-party platforms.

- **Edge Computing & CDN**  
  Implemented CloudFront edge functions and KeyValueStore solutions for real-time request filtering and access control at scale, maintaining sub-millisecond performance across thousands of domains.

- **Infrastructure & DevOps**  
  Maintained self-hosted Sentry for production monitoring and led major Jenkins CI/CD infrastructure overhauls. Experienced with Docker, declarative pipelines, and optimizing build processes.

- **System Architecture & Documentation**  
  Designed complex features and integrations (Salesforce, GAM, Anthropic API). Created comprehensive technical documentation, including process diagrams and system architecture, to break down knowledge silos.

- **AI-Driven Applications**  
  Built intelligent applications leveraging the Anthropic API for next-generation capabilities.

I enjoy solving complex technical challenges, designing scalable systems, and sharing knowledge with fellow developers. Thanks for stopping by—browse my repositories to see my work!
